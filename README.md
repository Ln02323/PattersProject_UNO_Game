# UNO

UNO: The classic card game of matching colors and numbers. 
Players take turns matching one of their cards with the color or number card shown on the top of the deck


## use ANSI escape codes
Use ANSI codes, so do not run the code in Windows CMD; however, can run it in IntelliJ, Git Bash, and it generally works in UNIX-bash.

DISCLAIMER: This code belongs to @sevdaimany. We adjusted it for the sake of our uni project :)
